- Now, instead of 
  - driver.ReportForecast() => driver.WeatherForecastApi.ReportForecast()
  - driver.GetReportedForecast() => driver.WeatherForecastApi.GetReportedForecast()
  - driver.NotificationAboutForecastReportedShouldBeSent() => driver.Notifications.ShouldIncludeNotificationAboutReportedForecast()
- I call WeatherForecastApi and Notifications extension objects, because they "extend" the API of the driver with methods for specific inputs or outputs
- WeatherForecastApi is an example of input extension object - contains triggers
- Notifications is an example of output extension object - contains assertions
- Some extension objects can be a mix of that
- They have two roles
  - grouping role (all forecast API actions are behind the WeatherForecastApi), which makes the driver object API surface smaller.
    - show in code
  - delegating role (logic related to similar actions is delegated into separate objects, making the driver smaller)
    - show in code
