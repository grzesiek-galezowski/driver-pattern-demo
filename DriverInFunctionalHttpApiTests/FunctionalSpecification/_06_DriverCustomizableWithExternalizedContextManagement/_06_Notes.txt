- ShouldAllowRetrievingAnyPastReport - shows externalized reported forecast id.
- this simplifies the driver even further, as there is no need to hold and pass _lastReportResult and there is no need for IAppDriverContext interface anymore.
- There is one more thing we can improve - the test has to manage all the results (with using keyword). 
  - This forces us to assign the result to a variable even when we aren't using it for anything
  - The next example will attempt to fix this.
